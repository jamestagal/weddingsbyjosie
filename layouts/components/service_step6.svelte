                Lorem Ipsum has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text <strong
                  >ever since the 1500s,
                </strong>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
