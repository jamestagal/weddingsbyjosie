                "description": "I am a sociable lady who loves to be with people, to talk, to entertain and to listen. I have a teaching background, I have taught in high schools and more recently I taught English to adults from diverse cultural backgrounds. <br /><br /> Throught these experiences I have gained many insights into the importance of cultural, beliefs and customs. From my own multi-cultural background, I can empathize with difficulties that arise due to language barriers in adapting to a new country. <br /><br /> I understand the importance of blending the legal requirements to marry in Australia to traditional religious ceremonies and I am happy to be a part of this and design a personal ceremony for you. I believe that with the skills that I have developed, I can offer you clear communication and at the same time I’ll be flexible and thoughtful to your personal, family or cultural needs.<br /><br /> With Marriage Equality, I am happy to perform marriages for same-sex couples and also Naming Day and Renewal of Vows Ceremonies.<br /><br /> <small><em>I offer you a no obligation meeting, simply a chat for you to meet me, before you make your decision.</em></small>",
